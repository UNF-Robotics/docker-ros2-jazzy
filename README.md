## Docker Pull Command
```bash
docker pull unfrobotics/docker-ros2-jazzy
```

## Development Environment Usage
Inside the container, there is an initial folder `/opt/ros_ws/src` that is
intended for use for to build ROS 2 packages. Sources can either be
downloaded into the container, or the recommended local mount, which allows
for development using a local IDE.

### Run Command on Linux
The following command will open a terminal to the newly created 
container that uses the host computers network. It also assumes that the
sources have been downloaded locally in `~/mypkg_ros/` and shared as a
volume in the folder inside the container.
```bash
docker run --net=host --rm -it -v ~/mypkg_ros/:/opt/ros_ws/src/mypkg_ros unfrobotics/docker-ros2-jazzy:latest
```

Then, to proceed change to the workspace directory in the container
and proceed with building, running, etc.
```bash
cd /opt/ros_ws/
```
